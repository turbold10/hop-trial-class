# JavaScript Basics Exercises

Welcome to the JavaScript Basics Exercises! This guide is designed to help you practice basic operations, type checking, and conditional statements (`if` statements) in JavaScript. The exercises are divided into three levels of difficulty: **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**. Each level contains 8 exercises.

---

## Easy Level Exercises

These exercises introduce you to simple condition checks, type verifications, and basic operations.

1. **Even or Odd Check**  
   Write code that checks if a number is even or odd using an if-else statement.

2. **Positive, Negative, or Zero**  
   Write code that determines whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero using if-else conditions.

3. **Equality Check**  
   Compare two numbers and log a message to say whether they are equal or not.

4. **Type Check for Number**  
   Use the `typeof` operator to check if a variable is of type `"number"` and print an appropriate message.

5. **Type Check for String**  
   Check if a variable is a string using `typeof` and log a confirmation message.

6. **Greeting Based on Value**  
   Write code that prints "Hello, World!" if a variable equals a specified value (for example, if the variable equals `"hello"`).

7. **Find the Larger Number**  
   Given two numbers, use an if-else statement to determine and log which number is larger.

8. **Not Equal Check**  
   Write code that checks if a variable is not equal to a specific value and logs a custom message when the condition is true.

## Medium Level Exercises

These exercises build on the basics by adding more conditions and working with multiple variables.

1. **Conditional Arithmetic Operations**  
   Write code that uses two numbers:
   - If both numbers are even, output their sum.
   - If both are odd, output their difference.
   - Otherwise, output two numbers

2. **Dynamic Type Message**  
   Write code that examines a variable’s data type using `typeof` and logs a unique message for each type: `"string"`, `"number"`, `"boolean"`.

3. **Range and Divisibility Check**  
   Use nested if statements to check:
   - If a number is between 1 and 100.
   - And whether it is divisible by 3, 5, or both (similar to a FizzBuzz check).

4. **Maximum of Three Numbers**  
   Given three numbers, use if conditions to find and log the maximum value.

5. **Simple Calculator**  
   Write code that simulates a basic calculator. Assume you have two numbers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`). Use if-else statements to perform the correct operation and log the result.

6. **Substring Existence Check**  
   Write code that checks if a given string contains a specific substring (for example, check if `"JavaScript"` contains `"Script"`) using an if statement.

7. **Password Criteria Check**  
   Write code that verifies whether a password meets specific criteria (such as a minimum length and including at least one number). Use if conditions to log whether the password is valid.

8. **Output Based on Variable Type**  
   Write code that checks a variable and, using if-else statements, logs a different message depending on whether the variable is a string, number, boolean, or undefined.

## Hard Level Exercises

These exercises require more advanced logic and combine multiple operations. They challenge you to think about different conditions and error handling.

1. **Palindrome Checker**  
   Write code that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards) using string operations and if conditions.

2. **Grade Evaluator**  
   Write code that evaluates a student’s numeric score with multiple if-else statements and assigns a grade (A, B, C, etc.). Make sure to handle scores that are below 0 or above 100.

3. **Custom Type Conversion**  
   Write code that tries to convert a string to a number. Use if conditions to check if the conversion is successful (i.e., the string represents a valid number) and log an error message if it isn’t.

4. **Leap Year Checker**  
   Write code that determines if a given year is a leap year. Use arithmetic (modulo operator) and if conditions to implement the leap year rules (divisible by 4, not by 100 unless also by 400).

5. **Array Type Filter**  
   Given an array with mixed data types, write code that loops through the array and builds a new array containing only the numbers. Use `typeof` inside if conditions for this task.

6. **Simple Login System**  
   Write code that simulates a basic login system. Check a username and password using nested if conditions and log appropriate messages for a successful login or errors (like a wrong username or password).

7. **Command Validator**  
   Write code that simulates user input by accepting a variable. Use if-else conditions to check if the input matches one of several valid commands (e.g., "start", "stop", "pause") and log a corresponding message.

8. **Dynamic Arithmetic Operation**  
   Write code that uses two numbers and an operator (as a string). Use if conditions to perform the operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`). Make sure you check the input types and handle errors, such as division by zero or an invalid operator.

## Final Notes

- **Experiment:** Don't be afraid to try different values and modify the code to see what happens.
- **Ask for Help:** If you get stuck, discuss with your classmates or ask your teacher for hints.
- **Practice:** The more you experiment with these exercises, the more comfortable you will become with JavaScript basics.

Happy coding!
