# JavaScript Loop Exercises (For Loops Only)

This guide contains two sets of loop exercises in JavaScript. All exercises use **for loops only**â€”there are no `while` or `do-while` loops. Write your code inline (for example, in a single script file or in your browser console). There is no need to wrap your code in functions.

## Easy Level Loop Exercises (15 Exercises)

1. **Print 1 to 10**  
   Use a `for` loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10.

2. **Print Even Numbers (1 to 20)**  
   Use a `for` loop to print all even numbers between 1 and 20.

3. **Sum of Numbers (1 to 10)**  
   Use a `for` loop to calculate and print the sum of numbers from 1 to 10.

4. **Iterate Over an Array**  
   Given an array (e.g., `[5, 10, 15, 20]`), use a `for` loop to print each element.

5. **Count Array Elements**  
   Use a `for` loop to count and print the number of elements in a given array.

6. **Multiplication Table**  
   Use a `for` loop to print a multiplication table for a given number (e.g., the table for 5).

7. **Print a Pattern**  
   Use a `for` loop to print a simple pattern, such as a row of stars (e.g., `"*****"`).

8. **Iterate Through a String**  
   Use a `for` loop to iterate over a string and print each character on a separate line.

9. **Print Odd Numbers (1 to 20)**  
   Use a `for` loop to print all odd numbers between 1 and 20.

10. **Reverse Array Elements**  
    Given an array, use a `for` loop to print its elements in reverse order.

11. **Calculate Factorial**  
    Use a `for` loop to calculate and print the factorial of a number (for example, 5!).

12. **Countdown from 10 to 1**  
    Use a `for` loop to print the numbers from 10 down to 1.

13. **Sum Even Numbers (1 to 20)**  
    Use a `for` loop to sum and print all even numbers between 1 and 20.

14. **Print a Number Pyramid**  
    Use nested `for` loops to print a pyramid pattern (for example, a pattern where the first row has 1 star, the second row has 2 stars, etc.).

15. **Print Index and Value**  
    Given an array, use a `for` loop to print both the index and the value of each element.

## Medium Level Loop Exercises (15 Exercises)

1. **Print Array Elements with Index**  
   Given an array, use a `for` loop to print each element along with its index (e.g., "Index 0: value").

2. **Sum of Array Elements**  
   Use a `for` loop to calculate and print the sum of all numbers in an array.

3. **Find Maximum Value in Array**  
   Given an array of numbers, use a `for` loop to find and print the maximum value.

4. **Count Occurrences of a Character in a String**  
   Use a `for` loop to count how many times a specific character appears in a string and print the result.

5. **Print All Multiples of 3**  
   Use a `for` loop to print all multiples of 3 between 1 and 30.

6. **Reverse a String**  
   Use a `for` loop to reverse a given string and print the reversed string.

7. **Filter Numbers Greater Than X**  
   Given an array and a number X, use a `for` loop to create and print a new array that contains only the numbers greater than X.

8. **Print Numbers with Their Squares**  
   Use a `for` loop to print each number from 1 to 10 along with its square.

9. **Build an Array of Even Numbers**  
   Use a `for` loop to create an array containing all even numbers between 1 and 20, then print the array.

10. **Print a Simple Triangle Pattern**  
    Use nested `for` loops to print a right triangle pattern of stars. For example, the first row should have 1 star, the second row 2 stars, etc.

11. **Calculate the Average of an Array**  
    Use a `for` loop to calculate and print the average value of the numbers in an array.

12. **Concatenate Array of Strings**  
    Given an array of strings, use a `for` loop to concatenate them into one string and print the final result.

13. **Find Minimum Value in Array**  
    Given an array of numbers, use a `for` loop to find and print the minimum value.

14. **Replace Specific Element in Array**  
    Given an array of numbers, use a `for` loop to replace a specific element (for example, replace every occurrence of 5 with 50) and print the modified array.

15. **Print Even Indexed Elements**  
    Given an array, use a `for` loop to print the elements that are at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.).

## Tips for Completing These Exercises

- **Stick with For Loops:** All exercises should be solved using `for` loops. This helps you build a solid understanding of this loop type.
- **Test Your Code:** Write your code snippets, run them, and observe the output to ensure your logic is correct.
- **Experiment:** Try modifying the ranges or data values to see how your loops respond.

Happy looping and coding!
